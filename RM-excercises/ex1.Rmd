# Rmarkdown
## Excercise 1
### Basic markdown syntax

Markdown is a text format that can be converted to formats such as HTML. The syntax is really easy. Here are some lists. Remember to use four spaces to indent.

  - Markdown 
      + is
          + awesome
  - and easy
  - to use

Numbered lists are also similar

1. We are
2. the EMBL
    + predocs

> Here is a 
> quote block 


This text is written in markdown. Here is some *italic text*, you can also use _underscores_. Here is some **bold text**, you can also use __double uncderscores__.

I can superscript like this 20^th^ and ~~strikeout like this~~.

Creating a link is very easy. Here is one to [EMBL's awesome website](http://embl.org/) yay. 

Here is a simple table

Table Header  | Second Header
------------- | -
Table Cell    | Cell 2
Cell 3        | Cell 4

It's also very easy to include an image from the internet or your computer
![EMBL logo](http://embl.org/layout/images/external/common/embl_logo.png)

I can also write some code like this `print("hello world")`

### Basic code chunks

This is a very simple paste statement
```{r}
paste("hello world")
```

Notice how the code and the output always shows. To hide the code, set `echo` to `FALSE` like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
paste("hello world")
```

If you don't want the chunk to be run at all you can set `eval` to `FALSE`

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
paste("hello world")
```


You can also insert code in-line. For example, 5 + 9 = `r 5 + 9`, or I think `r paste("EMBL")` is awesome.

### Tables

Here is a simple table

```{r}
# Define a data frame
df = data.frame(number=1:3, letter=c("a", "b", "c"))

# Print my table
print(df)

# Pretty version, you can give it a caption and left-align it with "l"
knitr::kable(df, caption="My table", align="l")
```


### Plots

Here is a simple scatter plot
```{r}
plot(1:10, main="My scatterplot")
```

Here are two plots side-by-side
```{r}
# Create plotting region with one row, two columns
par(mfrow=c(1,2))

# First plot
plot(1:10, main="My scatterplot")

# Second plot
hist(rnorm(100))
```
